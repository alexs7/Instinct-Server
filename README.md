# Instinct Server

This is a Java command line application encapsulated within an Eclipse project.
It provides a TCP/IP based server for communication with the [R5 Robot], and within it the Instinct Planner.
The R5 Robot also requires the [Instinct Planner].

For further details including a video of the robot, please see [my Web Site].
